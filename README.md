# AWSDataIntegration
Sample Data Project Using AWS Services

This repository contains a sample data project that leverages various AWS services to manage, process, and analyze data. The project demonstrates how to integrate different AWS tools to build a scalable and efficient data pipeline.
🚀 Features

    AWS S3: Used for storing raw and processed data.
    AWS Lambda: Functions for automating tasks and processing data.
    AWS Glue: Managed ETL service for transforming and loading data.
    AWS Athena: Serverless SQL queries on S3 data.
    AWS IAM: Identity and access management for secure service access.

🛠️ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

    AWS account
    AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
    Terraform or CloudFormation (if infrastructure as code is used)
    Node.js or Python (depending on the Lambda function code)
    Docker (for containerized Lambda functions, if applicable)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/JMAROUF/AthenaAws.git
cd AthenaAws

Set up the AWS environment:

    Configure your AWS credentials using AWS CLI:

    aws configure

Deploy infrastructure (if using Terraform):

    terraform init
    terraform apply

    Alternatively, you can deploy using AWS CloudFormation if templates are included in the repository.

Lambda Functions

    Navigate to the Lambda function folder:

cd lambda/function1

Install necessary dependencies:

    npm install   # or pip install -r requirements.txt for Python

    Deploy the Lambda functions using AWS CLI or the serverless framework.

Data Pipeline

    Ingest Data: Upload raw data files to the S3 bucket.
    Trigger Lambda Functions: AWS Lambda can be triggered based on S3 events .
    Data Transformation: Use AWS Glue to run ETL jobs to transform raw data into a structured format.

🔍 Usage

    After setting up the infrastructure, run the Lambda functions or trigger them via AWS events.
    Use AWS Athena to query the data stored in S3 (if applicable) with SQL-like queries.
    View logs and monitor metrics via AWS CloudWatch.

Example Athena query:

SELECT * FROM processed_data WHERE status = 'completed';

🌍 Environment Variables

You may need to configure certain environment variables for AWS Lambda or other services:

    AWS_REGION: Region where your services are deployed.
    S3_BUCKET_NAME: The name of the S3 bucket for raw and processed data.
    DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME: Name of the DynamoDB table used in the project.

🧑‍💻 Development

If you'd like to contribute or make modifications to the project, follow these steps:

    Fork the repository and create a new branch.
    Implement your changes.
    Write tests to verify your changes.
    Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes.

🔐 Security Considerations

    Ensure your AWS IAM roles have the principle of least privilege. Only grant the permissions necessary for each service.
    Use environment variables to store sensitive credentials or API keys securely.
